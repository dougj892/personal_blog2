There has been litigation as well, stalling the declaration of high-school results of students of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), and various state boards. This brief aims to demonstrate how the reliance on a simplistic metric of a 101point (0 100) scale for awarding absolute scores in each subject has resulted in a nearcomplete breakdown of the assessment standards in Indian board examinations, largely because of the existence of multiple systems. The boards are competing to stay relevant by awarding increasingly high scores, thus diluting academic standards and pulling down the public's trust in the assessment system.},

A simple theoretical model that highlights the role of comparative advantage in the optimal schooling decision is presented and used to motivate an extended discussion of econometric issues, including the properties of ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimators. A review of studies that have used compulsory schooling laws, differences in the accessibility of schools, and similar features as instrumental variables for completed education, reveals that the resulting estimates of the return to schooling are typically as big or bigger than the corresponding ordinary least squares estimates. One interpretation of this finding is that marginal returns to education among the low-education subgroups typically affected by supply-side innovations tend to be relatively high, reflecting their high marginal costs of schooling, rather than low ability that limits their return to education.},

Concurrently, all-cause mortality in the US is diverging by education\textemdash falling for the college-educated and rising for those without a degree\textemdash something not seen in other rich countries. We review the rising prevalence of pain, despair, and suicide among Americans without a BA. Pain and despair created a baseline demand for opioids, but the escalation of addiction came from pharma and its political enablers. We examine ``the politics of despair,'' how less-educated people have abandoned and been abandoned by the Democratic Party. While healthier states once voted Republican in presidential elections, now the least-healthy states do. We review the evidence on whether or not deaths of despair have risen during the COVID pandemic. More broadly, excess mortality from COVID has not increased the ratio of all-cause mortality rates for those without and with a four-year degree, but has instead replicated the pre-existing mortality ratio.},

This paper evaluates the long-term impacts of STAR by linking the experimental data to administrative records. We first demonstrate that kindergarten test scores are highly correlated with outcomes such as earnings at age 27, college attendance, home ownership, and retirement savings. We then document four sets of experimental impacts. First, students in small classes are significantly more likely to attend college and exhibit improvements on other outcomes. Class size does not have a significant effect on earnings at age 27, but this effect is imprecisely estimated. Second, students who had a more experienced teacher in kindergarten have higher earnings. Third, an analysis of variance reveals significant classroom effects on earnings. Students who were randomly assigned to higher quality classrooms in grades K-3 \textendash{} as measured by classmates' end-of-class test scores \textendash{} have higher earnings, college attendance rates, and other outcomes. Finally, the effects of class quality fade out on test scores in later grades but gains in non-cognitive measures persist.},

This question has sparked debate partly because of a lack of evidence on whether high value-added (VA) teachers improve students' long-term outcomes. Using school district and tax records for more than one million children, we find that students assigned to high-VA teachers are more likely to attend college, earn higher salaries, and are less likely to have children as teenagers. Replacing a teacher whose VA is in the bottom 5 percent with an average teacher would increase the present value of students' lifetime income by approximately \$250,000 per classroom.

A large number of studies from both rich and poor countries show that education is associated with better health. While previous work has thought of the effect of education separately for rich and poor countries, we argue that there are insights to be gained by integrating the two. For example, education is associated with lower malnutrition in most countries, but in richer countries the educated have lower BMIs whereas in poor countries the educated have higher BMIs. This suggests that the behaviors associated with better health differ depending on the level of development. We illustrate this approach by comparing the effects of education on various health and health behaviors around the world, to generate hypotheses about why education is so often (but not always) predictive of health. Finally, we review the empirical evidence on the relationship between education and health, paying particular attention to causal evidence and evidence on mechanisms linking education to better health.},

  abstract = {Empirical support for the human capital theory across the developing world predominantly uses years of schooling as the indicator for human capital. However, the learning crisis taking place in developing countries strongly suggests that schooling quantity represents an inferior proxy for this type of analysis (World Bank, 2018). This paper relies on cognitive skills proxied by literacy skills to estimate the returns to human capital for wage workers in the urban areas of 7 developing countries. By implicitly taking into consideration school quality aspects and non-school influences in human capital formation, cognitive skills better represent the rationale of human capital theory. The results in the cross-country specification show that, on average, an increase in one standard deviation of literacy scores increases net hourly wages by 8.5\%, conditioning on years of schooling. The findings are robust to the inclusion of covariates related to socioeconomic background and alternative human capital indicators. Interestingly, returns to skills vary greatly across developing countries. This analysis implies that the empirical support for the human capital theory is remarkably heterogeneous across the developing world.},

Our simulation shows that countries with identical potential learning could have divergent learning outcomes due to a gap between curricular and actual pace, and the country that goes faster has much lower cumulative learning.
